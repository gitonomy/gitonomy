Installation
============

Gitonomy is still under development, and no distributed version is available by now.

Requirements
------------

To work properly, web-application needs to have full right on repositories. If you can,
run the same user for web-frontend and backend application.

If you can't, use group permissions to allow it to be possible.

Install dependencies
--------------------

Dependencies of the project are managed using Composer. This tool allows you to install
dependencies in two lines::

    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar install

Configuration
-------------

You can configure the application through web setup using online installation on
http://localhost/install.php

This step-by-step configuration will guide you through the setup process of Gitonomy.

The configuration of the application is located in ``app/config/parameters.yml``.
This file can be empty. All parameters will then be loaded from ``app/config/parameters_dist.yml``.
You can override any parameter from this distributed configuration file.

Database initialization
-----------------------

To start using the application, you need to load fixtures in it. First,
configure your application as explained above.

When it's done, execute this on a freshly setupped application::

    php app/console doctrine:database:create # creates database
    php app/console doctrine:schema:create   # creates tables
    php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load   # load default application data

Then, you can connect in the application and delete users, projects to fit needs.

Manual installation
-------------------

**Add CRON job**

Edit your crontab and add::

    * * * * * php /path/to/gitonomy/app/console gitonomy:authorized-keys -i > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Install development version
---------------------------

The code is hosted on github. To clone it locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:gitonomy/gitonomy.git
    cd gitonomy
    ./super-reset.sh

This will setup the development version of the project, with demo accounts. It
will add demo repositories, too. You can connect using one of various
available accounts:

* admin:admin
* user:user
* alice:alice
* visitor:visitor
