          And I am on "/projects/todelete/permissions"
         When I click on xpath "//a[contains(@data-confirm, ""Yes, I want to delete Alice as Lead developer"")]"
         Then I should see "Yes, I want to delete Alice as Lead developer"
         When I click on "Yes, I want to delete Alice as Lead developer"
